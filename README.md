# SolidityOverseasTransactionProject
This project aims to create a decentralized solution for handling overseas transactions for goods, which typically rely on remittance firms and invoices, leading to long delays. Using Solidity, we will develop a smart contract that acts as a decentralized escrow between the buyer and the seller.
